# Project Idea
##Project synopsis:
â€“ For our group project, we will be creating a full stack library application. The application will
have all the functionality of a standard library. There will be a collection of books, with the ability
to add or remove books. Each book will have a unique identifier and will have the ability to be
checked out by a student or removed by a librarian. Each student and librarian will be registered
in our identity service. All books that are checked out will be marked as such and have a return
date. Books can be marked as returned using the website. Overdue books will have a warning on
the website, and an email will be sent out to the user who has checked out the overdue book. the
numbers of copies of a book, expected return dates of books, and details about the book itself will
all be easily visible in the UI. Librarians and other employees will have a slightly different view
in the UI, to alter and update the book collection as needed. Students and employees themselves
can be added or removed from the system, as only active students can check out materials, and
only active employees can manage the collection. Feel per student will be tracked and displayed
on the website.
